    "Founded in 2000 by a high school teacher in the Bronx, DonorsChoose.org empowers public school teachers from across the country to request much-needed materials and experiences for their students. At any given time, there are thousands of classroom requests that can be brought to life with a gift of any amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "DonorsChoose.org receives hundreds of thousands of project proposals each year for classroom projects in need of funding. Right now, a large number of volunteers is needed to manually screen each submission before it's approved to be posted on the DonorsChoose.org website.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to predict the chances that a DonorsChoose.org project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved, using the text of project descriptions as well as additional metadata about the project, teacher, and school. DonorsChoose.org can then use this information to identify projects most likely to need further review before approval and hence to save the time of volunteer reviewers so that they can focus on more solid projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your machine learning algorithm can help more teachers get funded more quickly, and with less cost to DonorsChoose.org, allowing them to channel even more funding directly to classrooms across the country."
