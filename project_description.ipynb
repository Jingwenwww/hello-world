    "An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is the process by which a private company offers shares of common equity stock to public investors, in exchange of capital. Those shares then can be publically traded on a stock market exchange. During an IPO, the company hires an investment bank (their \"underwriter\") to assist it in determining the quantity and price for the equity shares initially being offered for sale. The initial shares are typically sold to institutional investors at a fixed price before they can then be traded on the open market. Because expectations of value may be different between the initial purchashers of the IPO shares, and the open market once those shares are traded to others, they often is a rapid re-adjustment (up or down) in the price per share, between the price at which the stock is sold to the initial institutional investors (i.e., the opening price) and the price at which the stock equailabrates to after some amount of trading on the open market."

This information is contained in the __“Risk Factors”__ section of the IPO prospectus (the \"prospectus\" is a public document filed with the Government (SEC) as part of conducting an IPO. Although some firms might be concerned about the disclosure of sensitive information that could harm them in the capital markets and/or by competitors, firms are typically advised by legal counsel to be as transparent as possible in order to avoid future litigation (law suits) that could arise from witholding information. Therefore, there may be (or may not be) useful information in the text of the Risk Disclosure section that would allow one to predict what will happen when the stock begins to trade on an open market. That is for you to determine, in Step 2 below!"
